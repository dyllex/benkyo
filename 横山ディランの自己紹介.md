When I entered UCSD, I had already been studying Japanese for 3 years. A trip to Tokyo in 2009 elevated my passion for Japanese language and culture to new heights but also taught me that I still had a long way to go toward fluency. Thus, one of my core goals as a college student was to continue studying Japanese language. I was fortunate in that UCSD had a fantastic Japanese Studies program. 

Not only were the faculty excellent instructors, but they were compassionate as well. As an Engineering major, I had a very rigorous courseload with many classes that were taught in-sequence and only once per year. I had many schedule conflicts between my Engineering and Japanese language courses that ultimately would have forced me to discontinue my formal study of Japanese had it not been for the understanding and flexibility from my Japanese professors. 

Originally, I only intended on studying Japanese language courses, but my professors' genuine interest in my personal and academic success motivated me to pursue a minor in Japnese Studies. My foray into Japanese Sociology, Political Science, and J-pop were actually some of my most enjoyable and informative classes.
